Prompts: 

Search for all Friday-only fish fry events and dinners occurring every Friday within a 60-mile radius of St. Louis, Missouri, USA. Focus on current and ongoing events as of February 2026, prioritizing those that are recurring weekly on Fridays. Include a diverse range of establishments such as churches, restaurants, community organizations, VFW halls, firehouses, schools, or retail spots that host these. For each result, determine and clearly indicate whether the fish fry is available only during the Lenten season (typically Ash Wednesday through Good Friday) or if it's offered year-round or on a different schedule. Exclude any one-time events, seasonal non-Friday occurrences, or those outside the 60-mile radius (e.g., covering areas like St. Louis city and county, nearby Illinois towns such as Belleville or Alton, and Missouri suburbs like Chesterfield, O'Fallon, or Wentzville). Exhaust all available resources to compile a comprehensive, unlimited list of all qualifying results, without any caps on the number of entries—aim for completeness by deeply searching across multiple sources and cross-verifying for any additional or lesser-known events.
Gather comprehensive details for each fish fry, including:
* Full name of the event or hosting establishment.
* Exact street address with city, state, and ZIP code.
* Latitude and longitude coordinates (for mapping purposes; use precise GPS coords if available from sources like Google Maps, or estimate/derive them based on the address).
* Type of establishment (e.g., Catholic church, Protestant church, community center, restaurant, bar, VFW post, fire department, school, or non-profit organization).
* Link to the menu or event page if available (e.g., from the establishment's website, Facebook event, or local directory).
* Featured or signature item(s) on the menu (e.g., fried cod, catfish nuggets, shrimp, jack salmon, with sides like hush puppies, coleslaw, or mac and cheese).
* Availability of reviews or ratings (e.g., from Google Reviews, Yelp, TripAdvisor, or local food blogs), summarizing key highlights like atmosphere, portion sizes, wait times, pricing, and overall rating if possible (e.g., 4.5/5 stars based on 200 reviews).
Compile the results into a well-organized markdown table for easy reading, with columns for: Name, Address, Latitude, Longitude, Type, Menu Link, Featured Item, Only During Lent? (Yes/No/Seasonal), and Reviews/Ratings. Sort the table alphabetically by name or by proximity to downtown St. Louis. If no menu link, coordinates, or reviews are available, note "N/A". Ensure the search is deep, exhaustive, and multi-source: check local news sites (e.g., St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Riverfront Times, KSDK, KMOV), event aggregators (e.g., STLtoday, Explore St. Louis, Feast Magazine, Sauce Magazine), church directories (e.g., Archdiocese of St. Louis listings, parish websites), social media (e.g., Facebook groups like "St. Louis Fish Fries" or "STL Foodies", Reddit subreddits like r/StLouis or r/stlouisfood), Yelp/Google Maps searches for "Friday fish fry near St. Louis" with filters for distance and ratings, community forums (e.g., Nextdoor neighborhoods in the area), and local event calendars (e.g., from chambers of commerce in surrounding counties like St. Charles, Jefferson, or Madison IL). Cross-reference with user-generated lists on sites like TripAdvisor or AllTrails if relevant, and verify information for accuracy, recency, and any updates or closures by checking multiple sources. Include all results, even smaller or niche ones, to create a complete dataset suitable for generating an interactive map later (e.g., via tools like Google Maps API or Leaflet, using the lat/long coords).


Lets make this a one page HTML site that can be hosted in GITHUB and add a feature enriched map to show each of these locations. Add a slider, or some way of flipping through all locations or the different sections. next to or below the map, add a  list of the items in that section. next to or below that add a details pane of whatever item is selected with summary. When selecting an item highlight it on the map and display that locations data in the detailed pane.
